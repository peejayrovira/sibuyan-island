					<p class="lead justify-content-center">Sibuyan Island is isolated and not connected geologically to any part of Philippines archipelago  making the place serene and stunning.
					The undeveloped state of the island gives an impressive sights, which called the whole island Sibuyan as <em>“Pure Nature”</em>.
					Walking along the glorious strand of sand going to the other part of the island in its unspoiled state is a fascinating experience . The aquamarine water around  is stunning clear, where waves kiss both shores so gently.
					Totally no recreational and water sport facilities and desirable useful feature, but  it has everything that gives experience, simultaneously happens that provides a great time to immerse with pure nature.

	              <p>The Cresta de Gallo is a small island that is about an hour away from the South of Sibuyan Island. It is a perfect getaway from the busy city life. It a secluded island surrounded by crystal clear waters with a very fine white sand beach that is almost similar to the Boracay beach. Just minus the huge crowd and the amenities.</p>

	              <p>The impossibly clear waters of Cantingas River (the second cleanest in the world!) runs through a valley that has been carved by the eons.</p>
	              <p>The river’s cleanliness is incredibly well-maintained.</p>
	              <p>The waters are surrounded by the rich brown of the earth, and almost drowned by the thick green mounds of the surrounding forest. There is a tree-house like structure off to one side, which serves as a 4-level diving platform into the cool waters.</p>

	              <p>Lambingan Falls is probably the most commonly visited waterfall by tourists on Sibuyan Island. It is right near Magdiwang town and only takes a 10-15 minutes to reach by car or motorbike from the town. You won’t need a guide for this one it is signposted and there is no trekking involved.</p>

					<p>The falls are quite small but still very peaceful. It is a great place to hang out and chill for a while on the bamboo platform. </p>

					<p>There is a little cliff jump at the bottom falls, which is also a great spot to sit in the huts and have some lunch</p>

	              <p>Agbalit Forest Resort is a river resort with water coming from the same source of drinking water of Danaoeños. The water originated from the Kabit-tubi Falls located high up in the mountains and the same falls where the Cantingas River gets its water. It got its name from the Balit trees that are plenty in the area. Residents say that the water in the river gets colder and colder the longer one stay in the water.</p>
